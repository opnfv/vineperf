      "message": "Do the packet sizes need to be enclosed in parenthesis when specifying them in test-params now? Just curious on the way this is presented here. Is this a new requirement? Also it appears that they are being forced to appear as a tuple since you have the comma after a single value. My only concern is someone who is not fluent in Python which I don\u0027t believe is a requirement for users of VSPerf. They may not understand this is a requirement when specifying values as tuples with single values inside of parenthesis. If it is then we should document that in the docs somewhere in my opinion.",
