      "message": "Al, you have mentioned in the past, that we should express expected fluctuation and performance drop in case that TGEN in VM is used. I suppose that your comment is still valid, am I right? :-)\n\nBTW, Radoslaw was able to measure following values (64B frames):\ntrex_vm_cont (with 2PMD cores \u0026 3 cores for T-Rex VM)          tx_rate_fps: 15,601,796.000\ntrex_vm_tput (with 2PMD cores \u0026 3 cores for T-Rex VM)          tx_rate_fps: 15,655,988.500\ntrex_vm2vm_cont (with 2PMD cores \u0026 3 cores for T-Rex VM) tx_rate_fps: 7,428,399.400\ntrex_vm2vm_cont (with 6PMD cores \u0026 3 cores for T-Rex VM) tx_rate_fps: 7,440,594.700\ntrex_vm2vm_tput (with 2PMD cores \u0026 3 cores for T-Rex VM)  tx_rate_fps: 7,521,308.000\n\nMine were slower, but I guess, it is related to the platform (CPU speed). As of now, we were not able to utilize multiqueue feature in T-Rex VM, which would allow us to utilize more cpu cores for traffic generation. So what we see (15mfps) is a T-Rex limit in case that dpdkvhostuser interfaces are used with single rx/tx queue. T-Rex wiki states, that in case that VM uses SRIOV interfaces, the speed is much better.",
