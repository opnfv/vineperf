      "message": "For P2P fully meshed we should state the number of physical ports required. \n\nFully meshed with 2 ports is just the same as bi-di - afaict. Using many ports is operationally difficult and for NFV functions probably unlikely (I\u0027d imagine it\u0027s more efficient to add higher b/w ports rather that more ports)\n\nSo I\u0027d suggest that we recommend carrying out the test with both 2 \u0026 4 ports for the test and that in any case the number of ports used is reported. \n\nDoes that sound reasonable?",
