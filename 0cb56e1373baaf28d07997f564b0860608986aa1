      "message": "Ok, I think I can write the alternative case. Something like:\n\nThis test will be conducted under two conditions following the establishment of all flows as required by RFC 2544, regarding the flow expiration time-out:\n\n1) The time-out never expires during each trial.\n\n2) The time-out expires for all flows periodically. This would require a short time-out compared with flow re-appearance for a small number of flows, and may not be possible for all flow conditions.",
