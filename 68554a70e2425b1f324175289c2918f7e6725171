      "message": "Yes, my initial thought is that 10^-7 loss ratio would probably be inconsequential (measured across all traffic through a single vSwitch). There\u0027s some dependency on the rates we\u0027re using though.\n\nBut is the objective to see how much additional load we can add above the zero-loss Throughput and *characterize* the relationship between loss and excess load?  In this case we would simply increase load by fractional steps and measure the loss (and we don\u0027t need a threshold).\n\nPerhaps the answer is \"both\", and we need another test ;-)",
