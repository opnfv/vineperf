      "message": "Hi Christian,\n\nthis feature has been removed from OVS some time ago. Test is implemented according to the implementation available in OVS \u0026 DPDK versions listed in comment above the testcase. It seems, that some support of detach is being added back into OVS recently, but it seems to be work in progress. We plan to update this TC once detach support will be (fully?) back in OVS.",

The reason is, that we have to change DESTINATION ip addresses to correctly route traffic to VM queues.\n\nThis patch will work with other TGens, once we will change TRAFFIC dictionary to support more flexible definition of multistream feature to define both SRC or DST IP/MAC/PORT iteration (and appropriate support in our tgens).\n\nSo IxNet must be currently enforced or TC will fail.",
