      "message": "I don\u0027t think we will measure CPU and memory utilization in all of the tests, this would surely skew some of the performance tests measurements. for example in the LTD I tried to put the performance tests upfront to figure out the 0% loss throughput rate for a particular packet size, then later on we run the CPU and memory utilization test for that packet size only for the found rate (not all the rates). Which is why I think it should have it\u0027s own category.",
