      "message": "As far as I know, it was set to \"\" by purpose - to enforce user to properly set the target before the first vsperf execution.\n\nHowever I agree, that since DPDK 1.7 the vsperf Makefile script builds DPDK for x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc target. So it make sense to make it default. It might change with multi arch support in the future.\n\nAnyhow, it is not handy to have RTE_TARGET default value defined at two places. Thus I suggest to comment it out at 10_custom.conf, so user is aware, that it can be changed if needed.\n\ne.g. something like:\n#RTE_TARGET \u003d \u0027\u0027 # override default DPDK build target set in 02_vswitch.conf",
