      "message": "It is to note, that VSPERF interprets configuration files as python code per purpose. This feature is used to define dependencies among various options and to effectively write step driven testcases. In case that configuration files would use e.g. yaml format, it would be required to heavily modify vsperf code to achieve the same functionality.",

      "message": "This definition of frame/packet content is not flexible enough to cover future extensions. It might be good to introduce a new way (at least as an option) of frame/packet content definition, e.g. in form of scapy definition. It will allow user to configure huge variety of network protocols without any changes to vsperf itself. Of course, this will work only for some traffic generators (e.g. T-Rex), which are able to accept a scapy template.",

      "message": "I agree this description is not flexible enough.\n\nThe scapy part will only give the general format of the frame, the flow spec will dictate what goes into the addressing fields of the formed frame.\n\nJust looking at how flows can be formed: many fields (MAC, IP, port) can change to from different flow profiles which can have dramatic impact on the benchmark results (even on the same SUT).\nThis is a critical part of any benchmark that we need to standardize (i.e. define exactly how the flows are defined).\nIn NFVbench we also need to split flows into subgroups so they can be sent to different service chains, and this requires setting up the dest fields properly.",
