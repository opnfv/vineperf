      "message": "I think it\u0027s important to mention the full-mesh aspect that is unique to 2889. But this is also a minimum deployment scenario, just like many of the others.  For example, I can \nmeasure RFC 2544 with multiple passes through the vSwitch when there \"minimal\" VNFs in the path, and derive a look at the logical port performance compared to physical.\n\nAnother point, maybe we should reference the PVP terminology in a future release?",
