Such functionality would require a redesign of OVS/DPDK configuration anyway (including path to the script). As we might even abandon this script and manipulate /proc filesystem directly, it doesn\u0027t make sense to spent much effort on less wild(card) solution now.\n* introduction of another script matching this wildcard is not likely",
