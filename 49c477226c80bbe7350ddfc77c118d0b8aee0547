      "message": "I\u0027ve chosen this lowlevel solution, because:\n* it requires only minimal changes and thus it can be merged to Colorado as a bugfix\n* it seems, we would need to support also OVS delivered as binary package with given distro. Such functionality would require a redesign of OVS/DPDK configuration anyway (including path to the script). As we might even abandon this script and manipulate /proc filesystem directly, it doesn\u0027t make sense to spent much effort on less wild(card) solution now.\n* introduction of another script matching this wildcard is not likely",

      "message": "It is to note, that version 1.5.0 and older used a form 1.5.0r1, where \"r\" should be added by application. This is currently not supported by VSPERF, i.e. for any release candidate of 1.5 and older it will show 1.5.01 in the report.\n\nIn case anybody will miss correct functionality of old release candidates, I can prepare it. However from code simplification perspective, I consider support of DPDK versions starting with 1.7.0-rc0 as sufficient.",
