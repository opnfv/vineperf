Have I missed something",

      "message": "Hi Maryam,  I think I understand the source of confusion, let\u0027s see.  I didn\u0027t change the Title to \"RFC 2889 Max Frame Rate Soak test\" because it would tend to blur the relationship with the Prerequisite test that determines the load. But we want to be clear (for folks using IXIA and other equipment with pre-programmed tests) that this is a 2889 test with fixed load.  So....  would you prefer to see the names of the two Soak tests changed?  (when I looked though the description, there was nothing specific to RFC 2544, except the title).",
