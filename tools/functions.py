def settings_update_paths():
    """ Configure paths to OVS, DPDK and QEMU sources and binaries based on
        selected vswitch type and src/binary switch. Data are taken from
        PATHS dictionary and after their processing they are stored inside TOOLS.
        PATHS dictionary has specific section for 'vswitch', 'qemu' and 'dpdk'
        Following processing is done for every item:
            item 'type' - string, which defines the type of paths ('src' or 'bin') to be selected
                  for a given section:
                      'src' means, that VSPERF will use OVS, DPDK or QEMU built from sources
                          e.g. by execution of systems/build_base_machine.sh script during VSPERF
                          installation
                      'bin' means, that VSPERF will use OVS, DPDK or QEMU binaries installed
                          in the OS, e.g. via OS specific packaging system
            item 'path' - string with valid path; Its content is checked for existence, prefixed
                  with section name and stored into TOOLS for later use
                  e.g. TOOLS['dpdk_src'] or TOOLS['vswitch_src']
            item 'modules' - list of strings; Every value from given list is checked for '.ko'
                  suffix. In case it matches and it is not an absolute path to the module, then
                  module name is prefixed with 'path' defined for the same section
                  e.g. TOOLS['vswitch_modules'] = [
                      '/tmp/vsperf/src_vanilla/ovs/ovs/datapath/linux/openvswitch.ko']
            all other items - string - if given string is a relative path and item 'path'
                  is defined for a given section, then item content will be prefixed with
                  content of the 'path'. Otherwise tool name will be searched within
                  standard system directories. Also any OS filename wildcards will be
                  expanded to the real path. At the end of processing, every absolute
                  path is checked for its existence. In case that temporary path (i.e. path
                  with '_tmp' suffix) doesn't exist, then log will be written and vsperf will
                  continue. If any other path will not exist, then vsperf execution will
                  be terminated with runtime error.

        Note: In case that 'bin' type is set for DPDK, then TOOLS['dpdk_src'] will be set to
        the value of PATHS['dpdk']['src']['path']. The reason is, that VSPERF uses downloaded
        DPDK sources to copy DPDK and testpmd into the GUEST, where testpmd is built. In case,
        that DPDK sources are not available, then vsperf will continue with test execution,
        but testpmd can't be used as a guest loopback. This is useful in case, that other guest
        loopback applications (e.g. buildin) are used by CI jobs, etc.
