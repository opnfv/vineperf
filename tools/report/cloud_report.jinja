## 1. Introduction

The objective of the Anuket project titled **"Characterise Performance of
virtual network for Telco NFV Use Cases"**, is to evaluate virtual networking
in baremetal and openstack or kubernetes clouds, to identify its
suitability for a Telco Network Function Virtualization (NFV) usecases. As
well as this, the project aims to identify any gaps or bottlenecks in order to
drive architectural changes to improve virtual network performance and
determinism. The purpose of this document is to summarize the results of the
tests carried out on the openstack or kubernetes clouds, and, from these
results, provide evaluations and recommendations for the virtual networking.
Test results will be outlined in
[Details of the Level Test Report](#DetailsoftheLevelTestReport),
preceded by the [Document Identifier](#DocId), [Scope](#Scope) and
[References](#References).

This document is currently in draft form.

<a name="DocId"></a>
### 1.1. Document identifier

The document id will be used to uniquely identify versions of the LTR. The
format for the document id will be:
`OPNFV_vswitchperf_LTR_ver_NUM_MONTH_YEAR_AUTHOR_STATUS`, where by the AUTHOR
field should be replaced with the initials of the author and the status is one
of: DRAFT, REVIEWED, CORRECTED or FINAL. The document id for this version of
the LTR is: `OPNFV_vswitchperf_LTR_ver_1.1_Jan_15_CN_DRAFT`.

<a name="Scope"></a>
### 1.2. Scope

The scope of this report is to detail the results of the tests that have been
performed on the virtual Networking. This report will also evaluate the results of
these tests and, based on these evaluations, provide recommendations on the
suitability of the virtual networking for use in a Telco NFV environment.

## 2. Details of the Level Test Report

This section provides an overview of the test results ([Section
2.1.](#OveriewOfTestResults)) as well as detailed test results for each test
([Section 2.2.](#DetailedTestResults)). Also included are the rationale used to
evaluate each test ([Section 2.3.](#RationaleForDecisions)) and the conclusions
and recommendations for each test ([Section
2.4.](#ConclusionsandRecommendations)).

<a name="OverviewOfTestResults"></a>
### 2.1. Overview of test results

##### Test Environment

Below is the environment that the test was performed in:

- Cloud: {{tests[0].env.os}}


For each test, a summary of the key test results is provided.
{% for test in tests %}
#### Test ID: {{ test.ID }}

Below are test details:

- Test ID: {{ "%s"|format(test.id) }}
- Description: {{ "%s"|format(test.conf['Description']) }}
- Deployment: {{ "%s"|format(test.deployment) }}
- Traffic type: {{ "%s"|format(test.result['type']) }}
- Packet size: {{ "%s"|format(test.result['packet_size']) }}
- Bidirectional : {{ "%s"|format(test.conf['bidir']) }}
{%- if test.result['tunnel_type'] %}
- Tunnel type: {{ "%s"|format(test.result['tunnel_type']) }}
{%- endif %}
{% endfor %}

<a name="DetailedTestResults"></a>
### 2.2. Detailed test results

A detailed summary of the main results for each test is outlined below.
{% for test in tests %}
#### Test ID: {{ test.ID }}

##### Results/Metrics Collected

The following are the metrics obtained during this test:

|             Metric             |             Result             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
{%- for item, value in test.result.items() %}
| {{ "%-30s | %30s |"|format(item,value)}}
{%- endfor %}

### 2.3. Rationale for decisions

The tests conducted do not have pass/fail/conditional-pass criteria. The test
is simply conducted and the results are reported.
