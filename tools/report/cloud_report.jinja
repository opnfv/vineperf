## 1. Introduction

The objective of the OPNFV project titled **"Characterise vSwitch Performance
for Telco NFV Use Cases"**, is to evaluate a virtual switch to identify its
suitability for a Telco Network Function Virtualization (NFV) environment. As
well as this, the project aims to identify any gaps or bottlenecks in order to
drive architectural changes to improve virtual switch performance and
determinism. The purpose of this document is to summarize the results of the
tests carried out on the virtual switch in the Network Function Virtualization
Infrastructure (NFVI) and, from these results, provide evaluations and
recommendations for the virtual switch. Test results will be outlined in
[Details of the Level Test Report](#DetailsoftheLevelTestReport), preceded by
the [Document Identifier](#DocId), [Scope](#Scope) and
[References](#References).

This document is currently in draft form.

<a name="DocId"></a>
### 1.1. Document identifier

The document id will be used to uniquely identify versions of the LTR. The
format for the document id will be:
`OPNFV_vswitchperf_LTR_ver_NUM_MONTH_YEAR_AUTHOR_STATUS`, where by the AUTHOR
field should be replaced with the initials of the author and the status is one
of: DRAFT, REVIEWED, CORRECTED or FINAL. The document id for this version of
the LTR is: `OPNFV_vswitchperf_LTR_ver_1.1_Jan_15_CN_DRAFT`.

<a name="Scope"></a>
### 1.2. Scope

The scope of this report is to detail the results of the tests that have been
performed on the virtual switch. This report will also evaluate the results of
these tests and, based on these evaluations, provide recommendations on the
suitability of the virtual switch for use in a Telco NFV environment.

## 2. Details of the Level Test Report

This section provides an overview of the test results ([Section
2.1.](#OveriewOfTestResults)) as well as detailed test results for each test
([Section 2.2.](#DetailedTestResults)). Also included are the rationale used to
evaluate each test ([Section 2.3.](#RationaleForDecisions)) and the conclusions
and recommendations for each test ([Section
2.4.](#ConclusionsandRecommendations)).

<a name="OverviewOfTestResults"></a>
### 2.1. Overview of test results

##### Test Environment

Below is the environment that the test was performed in:

- Cloud: {{tests[0].env.os}}


For each test, a summary of the key test results is provided.
{% for test in tests %}
#### Test ID: {{ test.ID }}

Below are test details:

- Test ID: {{ "%s"|format(test.id) }}
- Description: {{ "%s"|format(test.conf['Description']) }}
- Deployment: {{ "%s"|format(test.deployment) }}
- Traffic type: {{ "%s"|format(test.result['type']) }}
- Packet size: {{ "%s"|format(test.result['packet_size']) }}
- Bidirectional : {{ "%s"|format(test.conf['bidir']) }}
{%- if test.result['tunnel_type'] %}
- Tunnel type: {{ "%s"|format(test.result['tunnel_type']) }}
{%- endif %}
{% endfor %}

<a name="DetailedTestResults"></a>
### 2.2. Detailed test results

A detailed summary of the main results for each test is outlined below.
{% for test in tests %}
#### Test ID: {{ test.ID }}

##### Results/Metrics Collected

The following are the metrics obtained during this test:

|             Metric             |             Result             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
{%- for item, value in test.result.items() %}
| {{ "%-30s | %30s |"|format(item,value)}}
{%- endfor %}


<a name="RationaleForDecisions"></a>
### 2.3. Rationale for decisions

The tests conducted do not have pass/fail/conditional-pass criteria. The test
is simply conducted and the results are reported.
