      "message": "@Al, @Maryam,\n\nif I recall it correctly, there was a requirement in the past to pass multiple \"streams\" through one VM. This configuration template allows to configure up to 4 NICs per VM, i.e. to pass a serial stream twice through VM or to have two parallel streams. It is easy to enhance default template to more NICs, e.g. up to 8 (to support up to 4 independent \"streams\" per VM). Let me know, if you find it useful (and the number of NICs to be prepared in default template).",
