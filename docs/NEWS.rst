May 2015
========

This is the initial release of a re-designed version of the software
based on community feedback. This initial release supports only the
Phy2Phy deployment scenario and the
LTD.Throughput.RFC2544.PacketLossRatio test - both described in the
OPNFV vswitchperf 'CHARACTERIZE VSWITCH PERFORMANCE FOR TELCO NFV USE
CASES LEVEL TEST DESIGN'. The intention is that more test cases will
follow once the community has digested the initial release.
