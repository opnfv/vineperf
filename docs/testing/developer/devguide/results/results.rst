Anuket Test Results
=========================
ViNePerf CI jobs are run daily and sample results can be found at
https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/vsperf/Vsperf+Results

Testcase names shown in the dashboard are combination of orignal testcase
name from ViNePerf framework and indication of used vswitch.

    Example:

    Testcase ``phy2phy_tput`` is executed for three vSwitch types: ``OvsDpdkVhost``,
    ``OvsVanilla`` and ``VppDpdkVhost``. In this case, following testcase names
    will be used in the dashboard: ``phy2phy_tput_ovsdpdkvhost``,
    ``phy2phy_tput_ovsvanilla`` and ``phy2phy_tput_vppdpdkvhost``.

In case of RFC2544 Throughput test, the recorded metric is FPS (frames per
second) without packet loss. For RFC2544 Back2Back test, the recorded metric
is back-to-back value (number of frames) without packet loss.

The loopback application in the VNF used for PVP and PVVP scenarios was DPDK
testpmd.

Guest interface types are ``vhost-user`` for ``OvsDpdkVhost`` and ``VppDpdkVhost``
and ``virtio-net`` for ``OvsVanilla``.
