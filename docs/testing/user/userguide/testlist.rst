OVS/DPDK Regression TestCases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These regression tests verify several DPDK features used internally by Open vSwitch. Tests
can be used for verification of performance and correct functionality of upcoming DPDK
and OVS releases and release candidates.

These tests are part of integration testcases and they must be executed with
``--integration`` CLI parameter.

Example of execution of all OVS/DPDK regression tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./vsperf --integration --tests ovsdpdk_

Testcases are defined in the file ``conf/integration/01b_dpdk_regression_tests.conf``. This file
contains a set of configuration options with prefix ``OVSDPDK_``. These parameters can be used
for customization of regression tests and they will override some of standard VSPERF configuration
options. It is recommended to check OVSDPDK configuration parameters and modify them in accordance
with VSPERF configuration.

At least following parameters should be examined. Their values shall ensure, that DPDK and
QEMU threads are pinned to cpu cores of the same NUMA slot, where tested NICs are connected.

DPDK NIC Support
++++++++++++++++

A set of performance tests to verify support of DPDK accelerated network interface cards.
Testcases use standard physical to physical network scenario with several vSwitch and
traffic configurations, which includes one and two PMD threads, uni and bidirectional traffic
and RFC2544 Continuous or RFC2544 Throughput with 0% packet loss traffic types.

======================================== ======================================================================================
Testcase Name                            Description
======================================== ======================================================================================

ovsdpdk_nic_p2p_single_pmd_bidir_tput    P2P with single PMD in OVS and bidirectional traffic.
ovsdpdk_nic_p2p_two_pmd_bidir_tput       P2P with two PMDs in OVS and bidirectional traffic.
======================================== ======================================================================================

DPDK Hotplug Support
++++++++++++++++++++

A set of functional tests to verify DPDK hotplug support. Tests verify, that it is possible
to use port, which was not bound to DPDK driver during vSwitch startup. There is also
a test which verifies a possibility to detach port from DPDK driver. However support
for manual detachment of a port from DPDK has been removed from recent OVS versions and
thus this testcase is expected to fail.

======================================== ======================================================================================
Testcase Name                            Description
======================================== ======================================================================================
ovsdpdk_hotplug_attach                   Ensure successful port-add after binding a device to igb_uio after
                                         ovs-vswitchd is launched.
ovsdpdk_hotplug_detach                   Same as ovsdpdk_hotplug_attach, but delete and detach the device
                                         after the hotplug. Note  Support of netdev-dpdk/detach has been
                                         removed from OVS, so testcase will fail with recent OVS/DPDK
                                         versions.
======================================== ======================================================================================

RX Checksum Support
+++++++++++++++++++

A set of functional tests for verification of RX checksum calculation for tunneled traffic.
Open vSwitch enables RX checksum offloading by default if NIC supports it. It is to note,
that it is not possible to disable or enable RX checksum offloading. In order to verify
correct RX checksum calculation in software, user has to execute these testcases
at NIC without HW offloading capabilities.

Testcases utilize existing overlay physical to physical (op2p) network deployment
implemented in vsperf. This deployment expects, that traffic generator sends unidirectional
tunneled traffic (e.g. vxlan) and Open vSwitch performs data decapsulation and sends them
back to the traffic generator via second port.

======================================== ======================================================================================
Testcase Name                            Description
======================================== ======================================================================================
ovsdpdk_checksum_l3                      Test verifies RX IP header checksum (offloading) validation for
                                         tunneling protocols.
ovsdpdk_checksum_l4                      Test verifies RX UDP header checksum (offloading) validation for
                                         tunneling protocols.
======================================== ======================================================================================

Flow Control Support
++++++++++++++++++++

A set of functional testcases for the validation of flow control support in Open vSwitch
with DPDK support. If flow control is enabled in both OVS and Traffic Generator,
the network endpoint (OVS or TGEN) is not able to process incoming data and
thus it detects a RX buffer overflow. It then sends an ethernet pause frame (as defined at 802.3x)
to the TX side. This mechanism will ensure, that the TX side will slow down traffic transmission
and thus no data is lost at RX side.

Introduced testcases use physical to physical scenario to forward data between
traffic generator ports. It is expected that the processing of small frames in OVS is slower
than line rate. It means that with flow control disabled, traffic generator will
report a frame loss. On the other hand with flow control enabled, there should be 0%
frame loss reported by traffic generator.

======================================== ======================================================================================
Testcase Name                            Description
======================================== ======================================================================================

ovsdpdk_rate_create_phy_port             Ensure a rate limiting interface can be created on a physical DPDK
                                         port.
ovsdpdk_rate_delete_phy_port             Ensure a rate limiting interface can be destroyed on a physical DPDK
                                         port.
ovsdpdk_rate_create_vport                Ensure a rate limiting interface can be created on a vhost-user port.
ovsdpdk_rate_delete_vport                Ensure a rate limiting interface can be destroyed on a vhost-user
                                         port.
ovsdpdk_rate_no_policing                 Ensure when a user attempts to create a rate limiting interface but
                                         is missing policing rate argument, no rate limitiner is created.
ovsdpdk_rate_no_burst                    Ensure when a user attempts to create a rate limiting interface but
                                         is missing policing burst argument, rate limitiner is created.
ovsdpdk_rate_p2p                         Ensure when a user creates a rate limiting physical interface that
                                         the traffic is limited to the specified policer rate in a p2p setup.
ovsdpdk_rate_pvp                         Ensure when a user creates a rate limiting vHost User interface that
                                         the traffic is limited to the specified policer rate in a pvp setup.
ovsdpdk_rate_p2p_multi_pkt_sizes         Ensure that rate limiting works for various frame sizes.

Quality of Service
++++++++++++++++++

A set of functional testcases for validation of QoS support. This feature
allows to configure an egress policing for both physical and vHost User DPDK
ports.

**NOTE:** Desired maximum rate is specified in bytes per second and it defines
the rate of payload only.

Testcase Name                            Description
======================================== ======================================================================================
ovsdpdk_qos_create_phy_port              Ensure a QoS policy can be created on a physical DPDK port
ovsdpdk_qos_delete_phy_port              Ensure an existing QoS policy can be destroyed on a physical DPDK
                                         port.
ovsdpdk_qos_create_vport                 Ensure a QoS policy can be created on a virtual vhost user port.
ovsdpdk_qos_delete_vport                 Ensure an existing QoS policy can be destroyed on a vhost user port.
ovsdpdk_qos_create_no_cir                Ensure that a QoS policy cannot be created if the egress policer cir
                                         argument is missing.
ovsdpdk_qos_create_no_cbs                Ensure that a QoS policy cannot be created if the egress policer cbs
                                         argument is missing.
ovsdpdk_qos_p2p                          In a p2p setup, ensure when a QoS egress policer is created that the
                                         traffic is limited to the specified rate.
ovsdpdk_qos_pvp                          In a pvp setup, ensure when a QoS egress policer is created that the
                                         traffic is limited to the specified rate.
