VSPERF_ is an OPNFV testing project.

VSPERF will develop a generic and architecture agnostic vSwitch testing framework and associated tests, that will serve as a basis for validating the suitability of different vSwitch implementations in a Telco NFV deployment environment. The output of this project will be utilized by the OPNFV Performance and Test group and its associated projects, as part of OPNFV Platform and VNF level testing and validation.
