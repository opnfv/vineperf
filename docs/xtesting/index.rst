********************************
OPNFV VSPERF with OPNFV Xtesting
********************************

============
Introduction
============
User can use VSPERF with Xtesting for two different usecases.

1. Baremetal Dataplane Testing/Benchmarking.
2. Openstack Dataplane Testing/Benchmarking.

The Baremetal usecase is the legacy usecase of OPNFV VSPERF.

The below figure summarizes both the usecases.

===========
How to Use?
===========

Step-1: Build the container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Go the xtesting/baremetal or xtesting/openstack and run the following command.

.. code-block:: console

  docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/vsperfbm


Step-2: Install and run Xtesting Playbook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands are described in OPNFV Xtesting Documentation. Please refere to OPNFV Xtesting wiki for description of these commands.

.. code-block:: console

  virtualenv xtesting
  . xtesting/bin/activate
  ansible-galaxy install collivier.xtesting
  ansible-playbook site.yml

======================
Accessing the Results?
======================

VSPERF automatically publishes the results to any OPNFV Testapi deployment.
User has to configure following two parameters in VSPERF.

1. OPNFVPOD - The name of the pod.
2. OPNFV_URL - The endpoint serving testapi.

As Xtesting runs its own testapi, user should point to this (testapi endpoint of Xtesting) using the above two configuration.

The above two configurations should be done wherever VSPERF is running (refer to the figure above)

NOTE: Before running the test, it would help if user can prepre the testapi of Xtesting (if needed). The preparation include setting up the following:

1. Projects
2. Testcases.
3. Pods.

Please refer to the documentation of testapi for more details.

=======================================
Accessing other components of Xtesting?
=======================================

Please refer to the documentation of Xtesting in OPNFV Wiki.
