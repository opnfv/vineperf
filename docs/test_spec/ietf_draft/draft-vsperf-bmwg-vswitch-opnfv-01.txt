                 Benchmarking Virtual Switches in OPNFV
                   draft-vsperf-bmwg-vswitch-opnfv-01

Abstract

   This memo describes the progress of the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)
   project on virtual switch performance "VSWITCHPERF".  This project
   intends to build on the current and completed work of the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in IETF, by referencing
   existing literature.  The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has
   traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated
   physical implementations of internetworking functions.  Therefore,
   this memo begins to describe the additional considerations when
   virtual switches are implemented in general-purpose hardware.  The
   expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV
   mission to support virtualization of the "telco" infrastructure.

Internet-Draft           Benchmarking vSwitches             October 2015


1.  Introduction

   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) has traditionally
   conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical
   implementations of internetworking functions.  The Black-box
   Benchmarks of Throughput, Latency, Forwarding Rates and others have
   served our industry for many years.  Now, Network Function
   Virtualization (NFV) has the goal to transform how internetwork
   functions are implemented, and therefore has garnered much attention.

   This memo describes the progress of the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)
   project on virtual switch performance characterization,
   "VSWITCHPERF".  This project intends to build on the current and
   completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in IETF,
   by referencing existing literature.  For example, currently the most
   often referenced RFC is [RFC2544] (which depends on [RFC1242]) and
   foundation of the benchmarking work in OPNFV is common and strong.

   See https://wiki.opnfv.org/
   characterize_vswitch_performance_for_telco_nfv_use_cases for more
   background, and the OPNFV website for general information:
   https://www.opnfv.org/

   The authors note that OPNFV distinguishes itself from other open
   source compute and networking projects through its emphasis on
   existing "telco" services as opposed to cloud-computing.  There are
   many ways in which telco requirements have different emphasis on
   performance dimensions when compared to cloud computing: support for
   and transfer of isochronous media streams is one example.

   Note also that the move to NFV Infrastructure has resulted in many
   new benchmarking initiatives across the industry, and the authors are
   currently doing their best to maintain alignment with many other
   projects, and this Internet Draft is evidence of the efforts.

2.  Scope

   The primary purpose and scope of the memo is to inform BMWG of work-
   in-progress that builds on the body of extensive literature and
   experience.  Additionally, once the initial information conveyed here
   is received, this memo may be expanded to include more detail and
   commentary from both BMWG and OPNFV communities, under BMWG's
   chartered work to characterize the NFV Infrastructure (a virtual
   switch is an important aspect of that infrastructure).

3.  Benchmarking Considerations

   This section highlights some specific considerations (from
   [I-D.ietf-bmwg-virtual-net])related to Benchmarks for virtual
   switches.  The OPNFV project is sharing its present view on these
   areas, as they develop their specifications in the Level Test Design
   (LTD) document.

3.1.  Comparison with Physical Network Functions

   To compare the performance of virtual designs and implementations
   with their physical counterparts, identical benchmarks are needed.
   BMWG has developed specifications for many network functions this
   memo re-uses existing benchmarks through references, and expands them
   during development of new methods.  A key configuration aspect is the
   number of parallel cores required to achieve comparable performance
   with a given physical device, or whether some limit of scale was
   reached before the cores could achieve the comparable level.

   It's unlikely that the virtual switch will be the only application
   running on the SUT, so CPU utilization, Cache utilization, and Memory
   footprint should also be recorded for the virtual implementations of
   internetworking functions.

3.2.  Continued Emphasis on Black-Box Benchmarks

   External observations remain essential as the basis for Benchmarks.
   Internal observations with fixed specification and interpretation
   will be provided in parallel to assist the development of operations
   procedures when the technology is deployed.

3.3.  New Configuration Parameters

   A key consideration when conducting any sort of benchmark is trying
   to ensure the consistency and repeatability of test results.  When
   benchmarking the performance of a vSwitch there are many factors that
   can affect the consistency of results, one key factor is matching the
   various hardware and software details of the SUT.  This section lists
   some of the many new parameters which this project believes are
   critical to report in order to achieve repeatability.

   Hardware details including:

   o  Platform details

   o  Processor details

   o  Memory information (type and size)

      versions, type and the PCI slot they are plugged into)

   o  NIC interrupt configuration

   o  BIOS version, release date and any configurations that were
      modified

   o  CPU microcode level

   o  Memory DIMM configurations (quad rank performance may not be the

   o  PCI configuration parameters (payload size, early ack option...)

   o  Power management at all levels (ACPI sleep states, processor
      package, OS...)

   Software details including:

   o  OS parameters and behavior (text vs graphical no one typing at the
      console on one system)

   o  OS version (for host and VNF)

   o  Kernel version (for host and VNF)

   o  GRUB boot parameters (for host and VNF)

   o  vSwitch launch command line if it has been parameterised

   o  Memory allocation to the vSwitch

   o  which NUMA node it is using, and how many memory channels

   o  DPDK or any other SW dependency version number or commit id used

   o  Memory allocation to a VM - if it's from Hugpages/elsewhere

   o  VM storage type: snapshot/independent persistent/independent non-
      persistent

   o  Number of VMs

   o  Number of Virtual NICs (vNICs), versions, type and driver

   o  Number of virtual CPUs and their core affinity on the host

   o  Number vNIC interrupt configuration

   o  Thread affinitization for the applications (including the vSwitch
      itself) on the host

   o  Details of Resource isolation, such as CPUs designated for Host/
      Kernel (isolcpu) and CPUs designated for specific processes
      (taskset). - Test duration. - Number of flows.

   Test Traffic Information:

   o  Traffic type - UDP, TCP, IMIX / Other

   o  Packet Sizes

   o  Deployment Scenario

3.4.  Flow classification

   Virtual switches group packets into flows by processing and matching
   particular packet or frame header information, or by matching packets
   based on the input ports.  Thus a flow can be thought of a sequence
   of packets that have the same set of header field values or have
   arrived on the same port.  Performance results can vary based on the
   parameters the vSwitch uses to match for a flow.  The recommended
   flow classification parameters for any vSwitch performance tests are:
   the input port, the source IP address, the destination IP address and
   the Ethernet protocol type field.  It is essential to increase the
   flow timeout time on a vSwitch before conducting any performance
   tests that do not measure the flow setup time.  Normally the first
   packet of a particular stream will install the flow in the virtual
   switch which adds an additional latency, subsequent packets of the
   same flow are not subject to this latency if the flow is already
   installed on the vSwitch.

3.5.  Benchmarks using Baselines with Resource Isolation

   This outline describes measurement of baseline with isolated
   resources at a high level, which is the intended approach at this
   time.

   1.  Baselines:

       *  Optional: Benchmark platform forwarding capability without a
          vswitch or VNF for at least 72 hours (serves as a means of
          platform validation and a means to obtain the base performance
          for the platform in terms of its maximum forwarding rate and
          latency).

   Benchmark platform forwarding capability

              |   +------------------------------------------+   |   |
              |   |                 NIC                      |   |   |
              +---+------------------------------------------+---+ __|
                         ^                           :
                         |                           |
                         :                           v
              +--------------------------------------------------+
              |                                                  |
              |                traffic generator                 |
              |                                                  |
              +--------------------------------------------------+

       *  Benchmark VNF forwarding capability with direct connectivity
          (vSwitch bypass, e.g., SR/IOV) for at least 72 hours (serves
          as a means of VNF validation and a means to obtain the base
          performance for the VNF in terms of its maximum forwarding
          rate and latency).  The metrics gathered from this test will
          serve as a key comparison point for vSwitch bypass
          technologies performance and vSwitch performance.

       *  Benchmarking with isolated resources alone, with other
          resources (both HW&SW) disabled Example, vSw and VM are SUT

       *  Benchmarking with isolated resources alone, leaving some
          resources unused

       *  Benchmark with isolated resources and all resources occupied

   2.  Next Steps

       *  Limited sharing

       *  Production scenarios

       *  Stressful scenarios

4.  VSWITCHPERF Specification Summary

   The overall specification in preparation is referred to as a Level
   Test Design (LTD) document, which will contain a suite of performance
   tests.  The base performance tests in the LTD are based on the pre-
   existing specifications developed by BMWG to test the performance of
   physical switches.  These specifications include:

   o  [RFC2544] Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect
      Devices

Internet-Draft           Benchmarking vSwitches             October 2015


   o  [RFC2889] Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching

   o  [RFC6201] Device Reset Characterization

   o  [RFC5481] Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement

   Some of the above/newer RFCs are being applied in benchmarking for
   the first time, and represent a development challenge for test
   equipment developers.  Fortunately, many members of the testing
   system community have engaged on the VSPERF project, including an
   open source test system.

   In addition to this, the LTD also re-uses the terminology defined by:

   o  [RFC2285] Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices

   o  [RFC5481] Packet Delay Variation Applicability Statement

   Specifications to be included in future updates of the LTD include:

   o  [RFC3918] Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking

   o  [RFC4737] Packet Reordering Metrics

   As one might expect, the most fundamental internetworking
   characteristics of Throughput and Latency remain important when the
   switch is virtualized, and these benchmarks figure prominently in the
   specification.

   When considering characteristics important to "telco" network
   functions, we must begin to consider additional performance metrics.
   In this case, the project specifications have referenced metrics from
   the IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) literature.  This means that
   the [RFC2544] test of Latency is replaced by measurement of a metric
   derived from IPPM's [RFC2679], where a set of statistical summaries
   will be provided (mean, max, min, etc.).  Further metrics planned to
   be benchmarked include packet delay variation as defined by [RFC5481]
   , reordering, burst behaviour, DUT availability, DUT capacity and
   packet loss in long term testing at Throughput level, where some low-
   level of background loss may be present and characterized.

   Tests have been (or will be) designed to collect the metrics below:

   o  Throughput Tests to measure the maximum forwarding rate (in frames
      per second or fps) and bit rate (in Mbps) for a constant load (as
      defined by RFC1242) without traffic loss.

Internet-Draft           Benchmarking vSwitches             October 2015


   o  Packet and Frame Delay Distribution Tests to measure average, min
      and max packet and frame delay for constant loads.

   o  Packet Delay Tests to understand latency distribution for
      different packet sizes and over an extended test run to uncover
      outliers.

   o  Scalability Tests to understand how the virtual switch performs as
      the number of flows, active ports, complexity of the forwarding
      logic's configuration... it has to deal with increases.

   o  Stream Performance Tests (TCP, UDP) to measure bulk data transfer
      performance, i.e. how fast systems can send and receive data
      through the switch.

   o  Control Path and Datapath Coupling Tests, to understand how
      closely coupled the datapath and the control path are as well as
      the effect of this coupling on the performance of the DUT
      (example: delay of the initial packet of a flow).

   o  CPU and Memory Consumption Tests to understand the virtual
      switch's footprint on the system, usually conducted as auxiliary
      measurements with benchmarks above.  They include: CPU
      utilization, Cache utilization and Memory footprint.

   Future/planned test specs include:

   o  Request/Response Performance Tests (TCP, UDP) which measure the
      transaction rate through the switch.

   o  Noisy Neighbour Tests, to understand the effects of resource
      sharing on the performance of a virtual switch.

   o  Tests derived from examination of ETSI NFV Draft GS IFA003
      requirements [IFA003] on characterization of acceleration
      technologies applied to vswitches.

   The flexibility of deployment of a virtual switch within a network
   means that the BMWG IETF existing literature needs to be used to
   characterize the performance of a switch in various deployment
   scenarios.  The deployment scenarios under consideration include:

5.  3x3 Matrix Coverage

   This section organizes the many existing test specifications into the
   "3x3" matrix (introduced in [I-D.ietf-bmwg-virtual-net]).  Because
   the LTD specification ID names are quite long, this section is
   organized into lists for each occupied cell of the matrix (not all
   are occupied, also the matrix has grown to 3x4 to accommodate scale
   metrics when displaying the coverage of many metrics/benchmarks).

   The tests listed below assess the activation of paths in the data
   plane, rather than the control plane.

   A complete list of tests with short summaries is available on the
   VSPERF "LTD Test Spec Overview" Wiki page [LTDoverV].

6.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization of a Device Under Test/System Under Test
   (DUT/SUT) using controlled stimuli in a laboratory environment, with
   dedicated address space and the constraints specified in the sections
   above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.
