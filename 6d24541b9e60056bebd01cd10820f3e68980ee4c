      "message": "Hi Miroslav,\n\nI presume (having benefited from your presentation) that the direct link from the TG to the Guest means that SRIOV is being used - or some other such direct-to-guest technology.\n\nIf so, it would be very helpful if that was stated explicity in a note of the diagram.\n\nCheers,\n/Billy",

      "message": "IPDV is a two-sided distribution, with positive and negative variation. the two sides are important to distinguish, especially the negative side which means that the traffic in a flow has become \"more bursty\". Let\u0027s look at some examples (or perhaps you have measurements to share?). In any case, we cannot use the abs(IPDV) usefully, and we may need to construct our own measurement calculations to get the needed info, IMO.",
