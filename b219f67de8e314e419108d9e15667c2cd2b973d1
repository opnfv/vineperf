      "message": "Hi - thanks for all of the merging.  The code works, but I had a couple of outstanding code changes that conflicted with one another so line 494 (self_moongen_line_speed) should have remained in the code.  Given the different code changes in the moongen.py I think it might be easier to create a quick Jira ticket and make the change back separate from this issue - does that make sense?",
