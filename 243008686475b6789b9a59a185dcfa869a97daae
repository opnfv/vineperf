      "message": "So we conducting a completely new RFC 2544 test where we install 10 flows that pass traffic then add and remove an equal number of flows and measure the throughput in fps? (I just want to be certain...)\nan interesting thing to see is another test where we just have 1 flow and measure the effect of adding 10, 1000, 100,0000 and 10,000,000 flows at a time to allow us to compare performance to our standard tests - maybe that can be a separate test to this, what do you think?",

      "message": "It\u0027s ok to test 2544 Throughput with one flow, but there should also be testing with multiple flows (see Sec 12 of RFC 2544).  I like the idea of replacing many flows simultaneously to keep the load equal, while causing a burst of control traffic. Maryam\u0027s test is pretty extreme and also very focused, but for all the testing the Throughput offered load level must be maintained, and the initial packet effects will be profound if too many arrive at once.",
