      "message": "This is headed in the right direction, but...    \nIt seems we need to include background traffic to occupy any queues in the path, otherwise the latency of single initial packets will not include the queue latency that subsequent packets would encounter when other traffic is present, and that might skew the results. I\u0027ll consider what it will take to write this description with background load and the removal of an established flow followed by its replacement with a new flow and measurement of the new flow\u0027s initial packet latency.",

      "message": "Hi Al,\n\nwhile your suggestion is certainly a more realistic scenario it could make the results very dependent on the nature of the background traffic and perhaps harder to repeat (especially say using a different test setup at a different site).\n\nThe latency introduced by the background traffic should be measurable by LTD.PacketDelayVariation.RFC3393.Soak and then this test measures just the latency of the initial packet. \n\nI\u0027m just thinking that by trying to measure two effects at once (initial packet latency *and* normal latency) we end up not measuring either effectively!",
