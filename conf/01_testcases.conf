# "Name": "phy2phy_burst",         # A human-readable string identifying the
#                                  # test.
# "Traffic Type": "rfc2544",       # One of the supported traffic types.
# "Collector": "cpu, memory",      # Comma-separated list of Collectors to
#                                  # be activated during this test.
# "Deployment": "p2p",             # One of the supported deployment scenarios.
# "Description": "Lorem ipsum..."  # Optional. A human-readable string
#                                  # describing the test.
