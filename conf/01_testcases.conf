# This file describes a list of testcases.  Each testcase is described as a
# dictionary in a list of dictionaries.
#
# The dictionary keys, their meanings and available values are:
#
# "Name": "phy2phy_burst",         # A human-readable string identifying the
#                                  # test.
# "Traffic Type": "rfc2544",       # One of the supported traffic types.
# "Deployment": "p2p",             # One of the supported deployment scenarios.
# "Description": "Lorem ipsum..."  # Optional. A human-readable string
#                                  # describing the test.
# "Frame Modification": "vlan"     # One of the supported frame modifications:
#                                  # vlan, mpls, mac, dscp, ttl, ip_addr,
#                                  # ip_port.
# "biDirectional": [true|false],   # Specifies if genearted traffic will be
#                                  # full-duplex (true) or half-duplex (false)
# "MultiStream": 0-65535           # Optional. Defines number of flows simulated
#                                  # by traffic generator. Value 0 disables
#                                  # MultiStream feature
# "Load": dictionary               # Optional. Configures background load
#                                  # during testcase execution.
#   Descritopn of "Load" dictionary keys, their meanings and available values:
#
#   "tool": "stress"               # One of the supported load generators.
#   "load": 0-100                  # percentage of cores which should be
#                                  # utilized by load generator
#                                  # e.g. load = 70%, detected cpu cores = 14 =>
#                                  # round(14*0.7)=10, i.e. 10 instances of load
#                                  # generator will be executed
#   "reserved": 0- (Default 0)     # Optional. Defines number of cores reserved
#                                  # for vsperf
#                                  # e.g. load = 80%, detected cpu cores = 14,
#                                  # reserved = 4 => round((14-4)*0.8)=8,
#                                  # i.e. 8 load gen. instances will be executed
#   "pattern" : "c"                # stress/stress-ng specific; Number of 'c',
#                                  # 'm' and 'i' defines ratio between cpu, mem
#                                  # and io workers respectively
#                                  # e.g. "ccccmmi" => ratio among workers types
#                                  # will be 3:2:1, so in case that 12 stress
#                                  # instances should be executed, then 6 cpu,
#                                  # 4 memory and 2 io workers will be executed
#   "load_memory": 0-100           # Optional. Defines percentage of the system
#                                  # memory, which should be utilized by memory
#                                  # workers (if they are part of "pattern").
#                                  # if not specified then default stress(-ng)
#                                  # value will be used
#   "options": ""                  # Optional. Additional command line options
#                                  # to be passed to the load generator.
