# The 1st value of SUPPORTED_TUNNELING_PROTO is used as the default
# tunneling protocol for OP2P tests.

# "Tunnel Type": ["vxlan"|"gre"|"geneve"]   # Tunnel Type defines tunneling protocol to use.
#                                   # It can be overridden by cli option tunnel_type.
#                                   # Values:
#                                   #    "vxlan" - iteration of destination MAC address
#                                   #    "gre" - iteration of destination IP address
#                                   #    "geneve" - iteration of destination UDP port

# biDirectional testing for OP2P is not yet supported.
