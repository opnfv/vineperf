      "message": "Hi Martin, I have a couple of points to raise:\n(1) Elsewhere, iLoad is another percentage that seems to overlap with frame_rate. (Sridhar\u0027s patch, I think)\n(2) Is the Reference rate the Line rate of a Physical interface? This will always be an odd number of frames, and change with frame size. \n(3) With a MIX of sizes, this is a complicated percentage to calculate.",

      "message": "Hi Al,\n\nthank your for our comments. Let me try to address them.\n\nad 1) It is different name for the same feature. iLoad is a label visible in vsperf user interface. However it internally sets value of  frame_rate. Patch which has introduced modification of frame_rate from the command line was\n\nhttps://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/#/c/2587/\n\nThis help describes low level methods and interfaces, so I think it is ok to have discrepancy between \"official UI parameter\" and internal low level \"parameter name\". However, I\u0027ll update frame_rate description here to state, that iLoad/iload is used to modify frame_rate value by user.\n\nad 2) iLoad/frame_rate value is used by IxNetwork to configure \"% Line Rate\", which according to IxNetwork help \"specifies the physical line rate\". \n\nad 3) These calculations are done internally by IxNetwork. We can check documentation if there are some doubts.\n\nBy the way, this patch has not brought any new features, It just describes, what is already available in vsperf for some time.",

      "message": "Hi Martin, thanks for your reply.  Since we will be using other traffic generators eventually, it\u0027s good to highlight when we are relying on Traffic Gen internal calculations because they may vary or may need to be added for other Traffic Gens.  (and differences of internal calculations may cause variation in the results)",
